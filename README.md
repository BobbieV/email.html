# email.html
Webpage with a :hover gag

I learned a lot about what html for email CANNOT do while creating this code.  It was initially intended to be sent as a single page email, but because it had become too advanced to be sent as an email, it was uploaded to gmail webpage service to be hosted as a single webpage.  It is a follow up letter with a radio selector that is reminiscent of junior high "do you like me (circle one) YES NO MAYBE" love notes from junior high school.  The gag built in, is that NO and MAYBE cannot be selected and will disappear when the mouse hovers over the top.
